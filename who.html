<h1>JSR</h1>
<h3>Take a look at what we have are doing</h3>
<p>We believe that sports are an integral part of our lives. So many times we are delighted by the performances of our sports stars in national and international tournaments. Especially today, the Indian sports scene is developing beyond the usual preference for cricket and hockey. The Sportshala is an initiative by the Passerine Group to bring out budding talent in various fields like basketball, cricket, football, skating, tennis and physical fitness. Sportshala is one of the best sports academies in Delhi NCR, offering the finest equipment and training in outfield sports, and a chance to grow your sporting career. We have also partnered with renowned sponsors and industry leaders to give youngster the exposure they need to become successful.</p>
<p>While half the world is crazy about soccer, in India Cricket makes the world go round. It is nothing short of a miracle the way Cricket binds this diverse nation together. It is the thrill that anything can happen on next ball. While there is an element of suspense in almost every sport, but it seems to be truer in cricket.</p>
